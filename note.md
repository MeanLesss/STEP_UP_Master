# FPM cannot bind port

# =======> if facing the permission problem for AutoLoad


The error message indicates that Laravel is unable to write to the `storage/logs/laravel.log` file due to insufficient permissions¹²³⁴. This is a common issue when running Laravel in a Docker container, as the user inside the Docker container may not have the necessary permissions to write to the `storage` directory¹²³⁴.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Change the ownership of the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories**: You can do this by running the following commands in your project directory¹²³⁴:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data bootstrap/cache
```

2. **Change the permissions of the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories**: You can do this by running the following commands in your project directory¹²³⁴:

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

3. **Clear the Laravel cache**: Sometimes, Laravel might cache the old permissions, so you need to clear the cache¹²³⁴:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

Please replace `$USER` with your username, and `www-data` with the user that your web server runs as¹²³⁴.

Remember to run these commands in your Laravel project directory, and make sure to replace `/var/www/html` with the actual path to your Laravel project¹²³⁴.
